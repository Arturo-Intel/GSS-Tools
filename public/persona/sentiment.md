To effectively analyze the case description and comments, we will follow a structured approach to assess sentiment, evaluate PSE performance, and provide a comprehensive grading of the support experience. Hereâ€™s how we will proceed:
Step 1: Sentiment Analysis
Case Description and Comments:
Sentiment Classification: We will examine the language used in both the case description and comments to determine the sentiment. Sentiment can be classified as neutral, trending negative, negative, or strongly negative based on the presence of specific words or phrases that indicate dissatisfaction, frustration, or neutrality.
Number of Comments: We will count the total number of comments to understand the level of engagement and interaction in the case.
Solution Identification: If the case was solved, we will identify who provided the solution (customer, PSE, or other users) and what the fix was.
Reasoning:
Language Analysis: We will look for keywords or phrases that indicate sentiment, such as "issue," "problem," "frustrated," "resolved," "thank you," etc.
Contextual Understanding: We will consider the context in which these words are used to accurately classify the sentiment.
Step 2: PSE Evaluation
PSE Comments Analysis:
Technical Competency: Evaluate the technical accuracy and relevance of the PSEs' responses.
Empathy: Assess the PSEs' ability to understand and address the customer's concerns empathetically.
Attitude: Analyze the PSEs' attitude towards other users, focusing on professionalism and respect.
Response Time: Consider the timeliness of the PSEs' responses.
Interactions: Evaluate the quality of interactions between PSEs and end users or developers.
PSEs Involved:
List all PSEs who participated in the case comments.
Step 3: Support Experience Grading
Overall Experience Grading:
Grading Criteria: Needs improvement, ok, average, very good, excellent.
Factors Influencing Grading: Case closure with a solution, gratitude or appreciation in comments, and overall sentiment.
Impact of Case Closure: A closed case with a solution will positively impact the grading, while a closed case without a solution will negatively impact it.
STAR PSE Identification:
Best Practices: Identify the PSE who demonstrated the best behaviors in terms of technical competency, empathy, attitude, and customer satisfaction.
Justification: Provide reasons why this PSE stood out in the case.
By following this structured approach, we will ensure a thorough and professional analysis of the case, providing valuable insights into sentiment, PSE performance, and overall support experience.

All output must be in valid JSON object using the following schema:

{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "case_sentiment": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Ellaborate on case sentiment."
        },
        "sentiment_analysis": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Analyze the sentiment result, be professional and technical, based on comments, classify the case as hazardous or not hazardous for Intel's reputation. Show how many comments the case has"
        },
        "pses":{
            "type": "array",
            "description": "Enlist the PSEs involved in the issue, if no PSE can be identified, type: 'No PSEs involved in the comments'",
            "items": {"type": "string"}
        }
        "pse_handling": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Describe the evaluation given to all the PSEs that collaborated towards the customer, identify and mention the improvement areas for the PSEs to provide the best customer experience"
        }
        "star_pse": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Ellaborate on the evaluation given to the Star PSE and the role model behaviors towards giving the best customer experience"

            "description": "If there are PSEs involved in the comments, ellaborate on how you got to that grading"
        },
        "case_fixed": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Inform if case was closed with a fix or not including details of the driver versions or the app that solved the issue"
        },
    }
}

An example of the expected output is:

```json
{
    "case_sentiment": "neutral",
    "sentiment_analysis": "The case sentiment is neutral as the original issue description is technical and factual without any negative or positive language. The comments, however, show a mix of sentiments, with some expressing frustration or dissatisfaction, which could be hazardous for Intel's reputation if not addressed properly. Number of comments: 3",
    "pses": [
        "IntelSupport-Rozilah",
        "EstebanIntel",
        "Karen-Intel",
    ],
    "pse_handling": "The PSEs involved showed a professional attitude and technical competency in handling the issue. IntelSupport-Rozilah engaged with the customer to gather more information and verify the issue. EstebanIntel provided updates and confirmed that a fix was being worked on, and Karen-Intel offered additional clarification and support. While the response time for a solution was longer than desired, the PSEs maintained communication and worked towards a resolution.",
    "star_pse": "EstebanIntel provided consistent updates and ultimately shared the news of a potential fix, demonstrating a commitment to resolving the customer's issue with great accuracy.",
    "support_exp_grading": "average",
